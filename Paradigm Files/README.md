#Paradigm Files
The paradigm was run on a 32-bit windows XP machine using MATLAB (MathWorks) and the Psychophysics Toolbox extensions available here http://psychtoolbox.org/ (Brainard, 1997; Cornelissen, Peters, & Palmer, 2002; Pelli, 1997).

The paradigm script is "DiscreteDots4Patch4_22_05_2014.m" The other scripts/functions in the "Paradigm Files" folder are called by  "DiscreteDots4Patch4_22_05_2014.m" 

This paradigm was originally programmed by Simon P. Kelly (School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University College Dublin, Dublin 4, Ireland) with amendments made by Gerard M. Loughnane (School of Engineering and Trinity College Institute of Neuroscience, Trinity College Dublin, Dublin 2, Ireland) and by Daniel P. Newman (Monash Institute for Cognitive and Clinical Neurosciences (MICCN), School of Psychological Sciences, Monash University, Melbourne, Australia)

Parameters in "TheUsualParamsCRT_TCD.m" will need to be changed to suit whichever stimuli display monitor you are using for the experiment.

The paradigm code is designed to be run with an Eyelink1000 desktop mounted eyetracker, however it can be run without using an eyetracker by setting the parameter par.useEL=0;
