#Questionnaires

Here are the two questionnaires used during the experiment:

(1) Subjective sleepiness was assessed directly before and after light exposure with the Karolinska Sleepiness Scale (KSS) [1]

(2) To evaluate their perceptions of the light conditions, participants completed a questionnaire directly after their third session, which asked them to judge during which of the sessions the light intensity was (a) the brightest, (b) the least bright and (c) of medium brightness.
